## Setup

### AWS Account

In order to complete this workshop, you'll need an AWS account and access to the following AWS services:
* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), 
* AWS Lambda
* Amazon S3
* Amazon SNS
* Amazon CloudWatch
* Amazon CloudWatch Events
* Amazon API Gateway
* AWS CloudFormation
* AWS Chatbot
* AWS CodeCommit
* AWS CodeBuild
* AWS CodePipeline
* AWS Secrets Manager

The code and instructions in this workshop assume only one participant is using a given AWS account at a time. If you attempt sharing an account with another participant, you will encounter naming conflicts for certain resources. You can work around this by either using a suffix in your resource names or using distinct Regions, but the instructions do not provide details on the changes required to make this work.

Use a personal account or create a new AWS account for this workshop rather than using an organization's account to ensure you have full access to the necessary services and to ensure you do not leave behind any resources from the workshop.

### Required Software

This workshop assumes that you have the following
* A web browser
* git installed locally
* Ability to access Github.com
